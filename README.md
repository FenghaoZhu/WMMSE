# Code Introduction
WMMSE.m : The main function.  
find_U.m : The function for finding the U in each iteration of the WMMSE algorithm.  
find_W.m : The function for finding the W in each iteration of the WMMSE algorithm.  
find_V.m : The function for finding the V in each iteration of the WMMSE algorithm.   
sum_rate.m : The function for computing the weighted sum rate.  
# Result  
Run WMMSE.m in matlab and get the following figure:
